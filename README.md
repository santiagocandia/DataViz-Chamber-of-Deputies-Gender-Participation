# DataViz-Chamber-of-Deputies-Gender-Participation
## Project Description:
This project describe Chamber of Deputies gender participation over time using Tableau and Python in Argentina. 
The idea comes from [FedericoÂ´s post](https://medium.com/@fedefluxa/diputados-g%C3%A9nero-y-python-un-an%C3%A1lisis-interesante-b71c646ddbed) in Medium wich analize the gender participation at the Argentinian Chamber of Deputies.
I used a different source than Federico, I worked with Chamber of Deputies open data base: https://datos.hcdn.gob.ar/dataset/legisladores
I worked with python to wrangling the data based on the project objective and then I used Tableau to develop the dashboard.
